# Compiler Course Lab

## Part1
1. Try to use recursion as much as possible.
2. Make some duplicate segment of code a function so that it can be reuse.
3. Note that expressions can contain statement in a way of expression sequence, thus it is important to not forget to count print in expression.

## Part2
1. The most important thing is the use of `Table_` and `IntAndTable` data structure.
2. Again, use recursion as much as possible.
3. It is basically the same as part1 except that we should maintain a data structure and actually compute something.
